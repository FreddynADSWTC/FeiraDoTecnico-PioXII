To stop a virus, simply enter the Task Manager and then end the "virus" by searching for its name.
Same as .EXE
dist > .exe

In Killim you need to hold "ESC", the mouse will go to X=0 and Y=0, then you release "ESC", if you press it again it will restart the code
You can kill it from Task Manager.
I removed the .exe, but to do them just use pyinstaller

> pip install pyinstaller
> pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=YYY.ico "./XXX.py"

XXX is the same as the .py file and YYY is the .ico file
If you use another method, I cannot guarantee that this way of closing will work, so it is at your own risk.

The new versions are designed to be blocked by the anti-virus, if they are not, they create folders in C: and create their files there
Keylogger and Printscreen are creating their files in separate folders, in total there are 4 folders created, of which 2 are used. In the future, probably in 1 week, I will leave everything in one folder.
Thank you to everyone who downloaded this file. <3
